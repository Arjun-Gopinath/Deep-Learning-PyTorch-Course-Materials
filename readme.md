# Deep Learning PyTorch Course Materials

### A beginner's guide to Machine Learning


This Repository contains Python Notebooks to learn PyTorch starting from the very basics of implementing gradient descent algorithm in Python, Numpy and slowly moving up the ladder to Deep Learning using PyTorch.

Make sure you have installed the following before getting started

- <a href = "https://jupyter.org/install">Jupyter Notebook</a>
- <a href = "https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a>
- <a href = "https://scipy.org/install.html">Numpy</a>
- <a href = "https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/install.html">Pandas</a>

## The Sections are Divided as Follows:

Modules| Description
--- |---
**1 - 4** | *Introduction to Machine Learning using Python and Numpy*
**5 - 10** | *Introduction to PyTorch*
